# Static Site that hosts Too Many Containers
A vlog of my modernisation journey and learnings specifically on running containers in AWS

Contains CDK code (infra directory) to deploy static website frontend by Cloudfront Origin Authenticated Identity (OAI) with an S3 bucket hosting files.
I could of used AWS Amplify for hosting and a managed CI/CD pipeline BUT I wanted to learn about CDK Pipelines and in turn see if it would be cheaper.
